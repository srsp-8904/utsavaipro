# Event Management AI Demo

This is a simple demo project i built for UtsavAi AI Developer Internship Round 1. It is not a perfect or big system just a small example.

## What this project do
It ask you some details like theme, guests, budget and reason.  
Then it will suggest some vendors and restaurants based on the theme.  
It also give one surprise idea for your event.  
At last it will show the total cost estimate and save all these things into a file.

## Why this is creative
Its not just printing data. It tries to do a bit more like matching theme with the restaurant menus and vendor styles. It also gives a surprise idea to make the event feel special.  
That makes the project more interesting than a basic cost calculator.  
Also, i made it so we can change and improve it easily like add new vendors or new features like graphs or pdf later.

## How i thought
I just make some lists of vendors and restaurants in the code.  
I match them with the theme and give the suggestions.  
Also check if total cost is under the budget and give some message.  
And i added a surprise part so it looks a bit creative.

## What you need
You can run this on python.  
No special libraries needed.  
After you give all inputs it will print the output and also save a summary file as event_summary.txt.

## What i plan next
If i have more time i will make pdf file for output, or make some graph or allow user to change choices.  
But right now its a basic version for demo and i can explain all these things in interview.
